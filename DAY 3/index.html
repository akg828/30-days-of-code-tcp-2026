  <p>Hello, I am a student of the Information Technology branch at the National Institute of Technology, Raipur.
I am currently learning web development and strengthening my foundation in programming through consistent practice.
My focus is on understanding core concepts, writing clean code, and building practical projects that improve both my problem-solving skills and technical thinking.
I aim to continuously grow as a developer by learning new technologies, applying them in real projects, and maintaining discipline in my learning process.
